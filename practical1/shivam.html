   <p><h1 style="color:white;background-color:green;"><u>5.Bibi-Ka-Maqbara,Aurangabad</u></h1></p>
<h2><p style="color:white;" align="center">Bibi-ka-Maqbara is often called the Taj Mahal of the Deccan, owing to its striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal. The fine tomb was constructed by Aurangzeb, in memory of his wife, Rabia-Ul-Daurani.

He accredited this glorious structure to his son, Azam Shah, who was born just four years before the death of Rabia-Ul-Daurani. Set against the mountain ranges of Aurangabad, the monument which seems somewhat like a copy of the Taj Mahal, still stands true to Aurangzeb’s love for his wife and is a beautiful sight to witness!</p></h2>
